# Database Normalizer

## For TA's

This is a special submission in place of an assignment, Dr Nel will be marking this himself.

## For Dr Nel

This is a JavaScript port of your Database Normalizer app written in Java.

### Running the application

The "compiled" version of this application is just a single JS, CSS and HTML file. I run it on a static web server, but you should be able to just double-click the HTML file.

The human-readable code exists in the `dev` directory. The "entry point" would be the `appController.js` file in the `controllers` directory. The classes are defined in the `classes` directory.

There are also (not comprehensive) Jasmine tests for these classes in the `spec` directory.
